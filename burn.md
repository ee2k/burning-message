# Burn after read service

## Creation page design

- Service explanation
- User could put text and images in the message
- User could set expiration time to the message, default 1 hour, maximum 72 hours
- The message will be deleted after the expiration time
- The message will be deleted on the server side upon delivery
- User could set Burn after read time to the message, 0.1 second, 1 second, 3 seconds, 7 seconds, 3 minutes, 10 minutes, to Infinity, this affects the browser only
- Use a progress bar for Burn after read time settings, default to 7 seconds
- The message will be deleted on browser side after the Burn after read time
- messageID and token will be generated by the server side
- If the token is not provided in the URL, the receiver will have to enter the token manually, the receiver could attempt 7 times before message self-destructs

## After message creation
- Upon successful burn message creation, the user could see the link to the message and a copy button, and a preview of the message

<!--
display images when finished loading images and text

timeout page will display some explanation, and a button to create a new message

or shall we use timeout page to display info when no message if found?

suggestions:

Use skeleton loading, display it when both text and images are loaded

for custom token, prompt for token, each failed attempt will increase the wait time for the next attempt, 6 attempts in 1st hour, and then increase the timeframe to like 2 hours or somehow
