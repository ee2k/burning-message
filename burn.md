# Burn after read service

## URL pattern

https://domain.com/message/messageID?token=one_time_token

## Creation page design

- Service explanation
- User could put text and images in the message
- User could set expiration time to the message, default 1 hour, maximum 72 hours
- The message will be deleted after the expiration time
- The message will be deleted on the server side upon delivery
- User could set Burn after read time to the message, 0.1 second, 1 second, 3 seconds, 7 seconds, 3 minutes, 10 minutes, to Infinity, this affects the browser only
- Use a progress bar for Burn after read time settings, default to 7 seconds
- The message will be deleted on browser side after the Burn after read time
- messageID and token will be generated by the server side
- If the token is not provided in the URL, the receiver will have to enter the token manually, the receiver could attempt 7 times before message self-destructs

## After message creation
- Upon successful burn message creation, the user could see the link to the message and a copy button, and a preview of the message
- QRCode could be generated

## TODO

- after receiving read message request, when should the server delete the message from RAM? The images may take some time to load
